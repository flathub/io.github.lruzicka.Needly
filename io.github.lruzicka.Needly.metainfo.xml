  <summary>Python Needle Editor for openQA</summary>
  <description>
    <p>
      Needly is an openQA needle editor written in Python. It creates or modifies needles for openQA tests.
    </p>
    <p>
      The openQA needle consists of two files: a PNG screenshot and a JSON definition file. The definition
      file provides various information to the openQA engine, including tags, types, and areas to look for.
      Users can use this application to edit (or create) all the necessary information quickly and draw the
      areas using the built-in WYSIWYG editor. When the needle is saved, it is fully compatible with the
      openQA engine.
    </p>
    <p>
      The advantage of the editor is that it does not need openQA to be installed on the system. The needle
      files are all you need to work with them.
    </p>
